I remember Kayla’s first day of kindergarten almost like it was . . . well, not yesterday, but still it feels like it can’t be that long ago. The first day of Kindergarten was an introduction to school, but it also serves as a template for life after school as well. There was an orientation night with a tour of the building and a chance to meet Kayla’s teachers. Thought was put into what Kayla should wear on the first day and any supplies she might need.

Throughout Kayla’s Senior year of high school, she has been going through a very similar process. She toured CMU’s campus, and began going through the process of learning what university classes would be like once she was accepted. And, the college classes she took via Shepherd High School and Mid Michigan Community College also served as preparation of what college classes might be like.

In Kindergarten, you feel new to the school but you also find yourself in a classroom filled with other students who are basically in the same boat, so it’s okay to be a little anxious. It is amazing to think about the relationships that exist today because of their early beginnings in Kindergarten. Sure, people change and you can’t always be expected to hang out with the person who shared their crayons with you, but there is value to something that’s lasted that long.

In college, you meet people who are like-minded when it comes to education but still have some of the same worries. New environment, new professor. You introduce yourself to a person you sit next to in a lecture hall, and then maybe happenstance could later turn into a connection.

Kayla didn’t go to Head Start or preschool like her younger brothers, so Kindergarten was truly her first taste of school. We dropped her off outside of her classroom, gave her hugs, and then said good-bye . . . and from that point forward, she was the author of her own story. She continues to be as she forges onward beyond high school and tackles bigger life goals such as college and career.

Thirteen years ago, we walked Kayla into school and watched her become a Kindergartner. Last week, she walked between a gauntlet of students towards a new beginning, stronger, taller, and prepared for anything that comes next.
