Just watched Kayla during the Senior Walk at the high school. As graduation day gets closer, and Kayla prepares to start college next Fall, It is becoming more and more difficult to deny that my little girl is all grown up.

There was a time when Kayla was so, so tiny that graduation from high school was just one of those things that we didn’t have to worry about. Back then, it was all about onesies and bottle feedings. Then, she could crawl, and soon walk, and it was about watching after her and keeping her safe.

I feel almost exactly the same even now that she is seventeen. I want her to be safe and happy. But, it seems more and more that I have far less influence compared to back when she was two or five. And, that’s how it should be. She’s reached a point where she will be living the rest of her life, and making decisions for herself.
