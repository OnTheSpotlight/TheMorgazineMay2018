I dedicated the first day of June towards the recognition of Kayla’s upcoming graduation and the mission of spending as much time with her and Elijah as possible.I took the day off and we spent most of the day together. We stopped by the library, and then spent some time at the park where Kayla was able to play with Elijah before she headed back to the high school to practice with the choir.

After Josh was home from school, we headed up for the last big thing I wanted to do before Kayla’s graduation ceremony on Sunday. This was to visit the Cops &amp; Doughnuts shop in Mount Pleasant. Cops &amp; Doughnuts has been a destination for us for many years. It started when we drove up with our friends, the Hollidays, up North to Clare. And, we’ve had many return visits since then.

One fun thing that’s available at each Cops &amp; Doughnuts location is that they set up a wall with hash lines where you can take your own mug shots. And, we’ve definitely taken advantage of this. Those photos may be the best way to illustrate how much all of our kids have grown over the last few years.

The trip that started it all by introducing us to Cops and Doughnuts in Clare began on Saturday afternoon when we were invited by the Hollidays to follow them on a Fall “Color Tour” up North. We made a few stops including Cops &amp; Doughnuts.

Here are photos we took during a visit to Cops &amp; Doughnuts in Alma with Kayla’s friend Hannah. Hannah’s family was getting ready to move, so this was a last chance for the girls to spend some time together. It also didn’t help to have a spare hand who could take a picture of the three of us with Elijah.

And, ironically, when we arrived at the Cops &amp; Doughnuts store we found out almost immediately that they had run out of donuts. So, we took the photos and then we stopped at Meijers and picked up a box of doughnuts from their bakery instead.
